But how does improvement work?

Below I've listed what seem to be the universal elements of an improvement model. 

Many of these come from the process of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), as employed by Darwinian evolution to improve the species. 

But others are unique to improvement efforts undertaken by humans, with our abilities to perform analysis and make predictions, and are drawn from things like the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method), the [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA) method, and the discipline of [configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management). 

When working on improvement efforts, one should consider all of these."
1	model	models	Pick Some Type of Thing to Improve	2023-06-03 17:16:49 -0700		"In order to improve something, you need to have some type of thing to improve. The thing could be a primate, a society, a note-taking application, a business, a business process, an airplane or a laptop computer. A type of thing will always have some [[function]].
"
1	model	models	Define the Thing's Function	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"A [[type of thing]] must have some function that it performs within a particular [[operating environment]]. 

That is, it must use some inputs and produce some outputs. 

Some outputs we can identify as useful (in some sense), while others may be categorized as waste, and others may be damaging or destructive. 

Often, amounts of these inputs and outputs can be quantified. 

In order to improve something, we generally want to minimize the inputs required, minimize the waste and damaging output, and maximize the useful output."
1	model	models	Define the Thing's Operating Environment	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"We must make assumptions/stipulations about a type of thing's operating environment in order to improve its [[function]]. 

If an operating environment varies significantly from these assumptions, then the type of thing may no longer [[perform]] as desired."
1	model	models	Determine Performance Measures	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"We can think of performance as a way of measuring how well a type of thing fulfills its [[function]]. 

For living things, performance is typically measured by population size over time.

Performance measures must generally consider both inputs and outputs."
1	model	models	Analysis	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"For improvement efforts conducted by humans, an analysis step must be introduced. Such an analysis would consider the desired [[functions]] to be performed, the associated [[performance measures]], alternative ways of performing those functions, and trade-offs between those alternatives. 
"
1	model	models	Consider Relationships to Others	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"When improving one [[type of thing]], relationships to others often come into play. 
"
1	model	models	Cooperation	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"Some types of things often work out cooperative arrangements with other types of things, for their mutual benefit. The output from one type of thing, for example, might provide the input to some other type.
"
1	model	models	Reciprocity	2023-06-08 12:45:18 -0700		"A thing may enter into an arrangement of reciprocity with another, with the understanding that provision of some sort of benefits will be repayed in kind at some future date. 
"
1	model	models	Specialization	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"Different types of things often specialize their functions in order to achieve more fruitful cooperation. 

Think of the queen bee in a hive, or the various types of cells and organs within a complex organism, or the roles within a company, or the various branches of government within a state."
1	model	models	Composition	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"One form of cooperation happens when a larger type of thing is composed of a number of smaller types of things. These could be atoms within a molecule, cells in an organism, states in a nation, departments in a company, or individual humans within a team. 

In all of these cases, some function is achieved or improved through joint cooperative composition.

In this sort of composition, the component pieces generally exhibit some degree of specialization."
1	model	models	Differentiation	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In order to achieve superior performance, some types of things become clearly different from other types of things with similar functions, often by adopting different strategies. For example, some species produce great numbers of offspring that suffer relatively high mortality rates, while other species produce smaller numbers of offspring that have lower mortality rates. In a similar way, different companies seek to differentiate themselves from their competitors in important ways. For example, one company might produce less costly products with less distinctive design traits, while another company might produce more expensive products with more distinctive designs. 
"
1	model	models	Type Design	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In order to improve a [[type of thing]], one must have a means of reliably producing such a thing, and this usually means having the instructions needed to produce or replicate it. For biological organisms, this is the genome. For a software application, it is the source code. For an airplane, this is a large collection of design documents, such as drawings and parts lists (or 3-D models). For a nation, it is a constitution. 

Note that a type design must always be specified using a known type design language."
1	model	models	Type Design Language	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In order to make use of a [[type design]], there must first exist some language(s) that can be used to reliably and repeatably interpret such a set of instructions, in order to produce more instances of the [[type of thing]]. 
"
1	model	models	Change	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In order to improve a [[type of thing]], we must make some change to it. 

In other words, we must introduce some variation. 

This will generally consist of some change to the [[type design]] of the thing.

Note that a change can be accidental and made at random (as is the case with biological evolution), or it can be made based on some [[analysis]], with some forethought and anticipation of the consequences (as is generally the case with human design)."
1	model	models	Retention	2023-06-07 15:17:49 -0700		"[[Change]] can bring both opportunities and danger, and so our brains are finely attuned to pay special attention to things that are changing. 

We also associate change with progress, and so it is easy for us to think of change as the most important element of improvement. 

But this impression is deceptive. Some degree of change is essential, but the amount of change that is introduced is generally dwarfed by the numbers of characteristics that are retained without modification. 

In order for things to continue to fulfill their functions, design attributes that work must largely be retained. Changing everything at once is generally a recipe for disaster. As in classic scientific experimentation, it's best to keep all of the variables constant except one."
1	model	models	Production	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"After making [[changes]] to a [[type design]], more instances of the [[type of thing]] must be produced -- or reproduced, if you will -- in order to assess the [[performance]] of the changes. 

We could think of the initial instances produced after some change to the type design as prototypes."
1	model	models	Competition	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In order to determine whether some [[change]] has improved the [[performance]] of a [[type of thing]], some form of competition must take place. 

This can be competition between a new version of a thing and an older version, using some sort of reliable [[performance]] measures. 

Or it can be competition between new versions and old versions performed in, or on, the field. 

For biological entities, performance is often measured by comparing the relative quantities of instances of the new design (population sizes) to comparable numbers for the old design. If the new design crowds out the old, then it has won the competition. 

Something similar occurs in competition between companies and products in a market economy. 

In sports, such testing is ultimately performed on the playing field, as individuals and groups compete with each other.

In science and engineering, such competition often takes place in a lab, and is referred to as testing."
1	model	models	Change Disposition	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"The results of the [[competition]] will generally result in a [[change]] disposition: a decision to either retain the change as an improvement, or to reject it. 
"
1	model	models	Change Incorporation	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"If the [[Change Disposition]] has resulted in acceptance of the [[change]] as an improvement, then the [[type design]] used for [[production]] of additional units will generally be modified to incorporate the change.
"
1	model	models	The Cynefin Framework	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"[[Dave Snowden]]'s [Cynefin framework][cynefin] offers a useful guide to differing approaches that are appropriate for situations with varying degrees of certainty. 

[cynefin]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework

The Cynefin framework suggests four different approaches, starting with situations of high certainty, and proceeding to situations with progressively lower degrees of certainty. 

Leaders and decision-makers tend to get into trouble by estimating the degree of certainty in a situation to be higher than it actually is."
1	model	models	Clear Situations	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In Clear situations, the appropriate approach is to Sense, Categorize and then Respond, making use of an established best practice. 

In other words, a mechanical or proceduralized response is most appropriate."
1	model	models	Complicated Situations	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In Complicated situations, the appropriate approach is to Sense, Analyze and then Respond, making use of expert knowledge. 

In  other words, some serious analysis is required, and the right answer cannot simply be selected from a number of predetermined choices."
1	model	models	Complex Situations	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In Complex situations, the recommended approach is to Probe, Sense and then Respond, allowing new knowledge to emerge. 

In other words,  analysis based on existing knowledge is not enough, and some experimentation is called for."
1	model	models	Chaotic Situations	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"In Chaotic situations, the appropriate approach is to Act, Sense and then Respond, learning and adjusting as you go. 

In other words, something unexpected has happened, you are in crisis mode,  and there is no opportunity for analysis or experimentation -- immediate action is necessary."
1	model	models	Core Design Principles for the Efficacy of Groups	2023-06-03 15:17:11 -0700		"These are eight principles that, when followed, improve the effectiveness of human groups.

And when we use the word ""group,"" I take this to mean a group of humans deriving perceived benefit from a shared set of resources, working towards a common goal, with some unifying identity, and with established means of interaction.

I originally encountered these principles in [David Sloan Wilson][wilson]'s book, *[This View of Life][tvol].* If you'd like another description of these principles that is freely available on the web, you can refer to this [PDF](https://evolution-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Generalizing-the-Core.pdf) of an article originally published in the *Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization*. 

[Elinor Ostrom][lin] won a Nobel Prize for her work in this area. These principles were based -- not on abstract or aspirational ideas about how such groups *should* work, or reasons why they *could not possibly work* -- but on actual observation of the attributes of groups that *actually did work*.

As soon as I read these, I recognized their significance, and the ways in which they supported and mirrored many of the principles of the [Agile software development][agile] movement, with which I was already familiar.  

I believe these principles to be universal and scalable to groups of any size.

"
1	model	models	The Four Quadrants	2023-06-03 17:48:18 -0700	Ken Wilber	"I originally came across this model in a book by [[authors/Ken Wilber|Ken Wilber]], titled *[[works/A Brief History of Everything|A Brief History of Everything]]*.

It's become a foundational piece of Wilber's Integral Philosophy, something he terms *AQAL*, for *All Quadrants, All Levels*. 

But I've found over the years that the Four Quadrants model can stand on its own, and be usefully understood and applied without reference to other pieces of Wilber's philosopy. 

I'm going to describe my understanding of this model, as it applies to us humans. (Wilber often describes it in more general, broadly philosophical terms.)

## In Brief

We tend to perceive reality from four different perspectives, ofter referred as the four quadrants. Understanding these perspectives as four valid and complementary ways of perceiving the world helps us gain a more complete and useful understanding of people and situations. 

An understanding of these four quadrants of perception is useful because it helps us understand that very different views of reality (Freudian psychology vs. Skinner's behaviorism, for example) are not contradictory or mutually exclusive, but rather are complementary. Views from these different perspectives may be equally valid, even if they are very different ways of looking at the world.

The four quadrants are formed by the intersection of two dimensions.

The first dimension (left or right) can be expressed as either interior or exterior. The second dimension (up or down) can be expressed as either individual or collective. Combining these, we get the four quadrants.

We can think of these as the [[individual subjective]], the [[individual objective]], the [[social objective]] and the [[social subjective]].

## Harari's Distinctions

It's worth noting that Yuval Noah Harari, in his book *Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind*, uses the terms subjective, intersubjective and objective to describe, respectively, the upper-left, lower-left and right-hand sides of the four quadrants, defining them like this:

* “An objective [right-hand] phenomenon exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs."" 

* ""The subjective [upper-left] is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single individual. It disappears or changes if that particular individual changes his or her beliefs.""

* ""The intersubjective [lower-left] is something that exists within the communication network linking the subjective consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his or her beliefs, or even dies, it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs, the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear.""

## Example of Application from Rob Austin

The Four Quadrants model can be applied in all sorts of contexts, which is part of what makes it so useful. Let me give you a couple of business examples. Take a look at the following words from [Rob Austin][austin] in his insightful little book, <cite>[Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations][austin1]</cite>.

> One frequent analogy casts the manager in the role of an airplane pilot guided by organizational measures that are like cockpit instruments.
>
> Mechanistic and organic analogies are flawed because they are too simplistic. Kaplan and Norton's cockpit analogy would be more accurate if it included a multitude of tiny gremlins controlling wing flaps, fuel flow, and so on of a plane being buffeted by winds and generally struggling against nature, but with the gremlins always controlling information flow back to the cockpit instruments, for fear that the pilot might find gremlin replacements. It would not be surprising if airplanes guided this way occasionally flew into mountainsides when they seemed to be progressing smoothly toward their destinations.

Note that Rob starts with exterior perspectives of collectives: a manager guiding an organization, and a pilot flying an aircraft. But then he goes on to expose the interior feeling (fear) of individuals who are not only being guided, but being asked to objectively report the data on which their performance will be graded! He then suggests the sort of culture (interior) such a collective of ""gremlins"" might develop in such conditions, and what sort of collective behavior they might exhibit. So, while Austin may not have consciously or explicitly referred to the Four Quadrants model, seeing his work as an example of this model may help us gain similarly powerful insights in other situations.

## Example of Application from Liker & Hoseus

Here is another example, from <cite>[Toyota Culture: The Heart and Soul of The Toyota Way][toyota-culture]</cite>, by Jeffrey Liker and Mike Hoseus. Here, Mike tells a story of learning first-hand some of the elements of the Toyota culture.

> As a new group leader, I was sent to Tsutsumi to spend a month getting an appreciation of working on the line and mastering one process. The team leaders told us no one would be able to complete the whole job by the end of the month, but I was determined to prove them wrong. I was installing liners underneath the wheel well when my air gun slipped, and the driver bit scratched the paint on the inner lip of the wheel well. I gasped and looked around -- no one saw me do it -- but they had told me to pull the andon (rope) cord if I made or caught any defect. It was my moment of truth. My first reaction was to let it go. No one would probably see the scratch anyway, and no one would know that I made it. But my conscience got the best of me, and I wanted to see if they really meant what they said about admitting mistakes. So I pulled the andon and the team leader came to fix the problem and showed me how to hold the bit with a free finger in order to stabilize it better: But he did not seem angry at me for making the scratch.
>
> Then at break we gathered for our afternoon group meeting where the group leader gave out information on safety and quality issues and heard back concerns from the members.
>
> They spoke Japanese so I could not understand what they were saying until I heard the words, ""Mike-san."" Well that got my attention so I listened carefully...more Japanese and then ""scratchee scratchee"" ...and then more Japanese. So here it was; finally I was going to get called out for messing up and they were going to do it in front of everyone. Then, all of a sudden, the whole group looked at me and clapped and smiled and patted my back and shook my hand as they headed back to the line. I couldn't believe it, after double checking with an interpreter just to make sure, they were applauding me because I made a mistake and admitted it. I felt like a million bucks, and guess what I did the next time I made a mistake?

Notice how the story talks about individual behavior (Exterior of an Individual), group behavior (Exterior of a Collective), individual feelings (Interior of an Individual) and group culture (Interior of a Collective). And while these are four distinct perspectives, they are all describing the same set of events. Note also that, while these are distinctly different perspectives, they are not unrelated -- quite the opposite, in fact: Mike's story clearly shows how an individual and then a group responded to an event, how the culture was evidenced by the group's behavior, and then how that behavior made an individual feel, which influenced his future feelings and behavior!

This is the beauty of the Four Quadrants model, in that it gives us a complete picture of reality, and increases our understanding of that reality. Many lean transformation efforts fail, for example, because they are focused only on productivity improvements (Exterior of a Collective) and fail to instill the corresponding cultural elements necessary to support the desired behavior.

1	model	models	Individual Subjective	2023-06-03 17:38:44 -0700		"Each of us experiences a complex inner world of sensations, emotions, thoughts and feelings.

And while others may report having similar feelings -- or very different ones -- no one else can actually experience our inner world in the same way that we can.

These inner experiences can vary from the mundane -- hunger, pain, fear -- to the sublime -- wonder, love, reverence.

The inner experiences that we have can be highly individual -- you and I may have very different inner reactions to something happening in the world around us.

And the relationships between external stimuli and our inner feelings can sometimes be obvious,  but at other times rather complex and even mysterious.

When considering the multiple perspectives we can take regarding a thing, some of these viewpoints may fairly be considered subjective.

This is not to imply that subjective views are invalid, or unworthy of consideration -- far from it.

Unlike subjective perspectives, other objective observers should be able to put themselves in our shoes, and make the same observations that we have, from the same perspective.

One of the advantages of an objective perspective is that multiple independent observers should be able to agree on the characteristics or attributes of an object being observed, and can therefore reach agreement on what we generally describe as the facts of the matter.

Each one of us is a member of one or more groups. We may be part of a family, part of a team, part of an organization, part of a state. And such groups tend to have their own special perspectives, and their own sets of interests. And members of such groups tend to share certain attributes of their interior worlds, such as a common set of values.  

Elements of our cultures -- shared symbols and stories and other artifacts -- help to bind us together into closely knit societies by encouraging and shaping common inner thoughts and feelings about the forms of our societies, and the ways in which we work together.
