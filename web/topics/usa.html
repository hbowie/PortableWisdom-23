<h2>Notable Quotations on the topic of USA</h2>

		<hr />

		<h3>A Coke is a Coke</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>What&#8217;s great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good. Liz Taylor knows it, the President knows it, the bum knows it, and you know it. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the book
			<cite>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</cite>
		</p>
		<p>&mdash; 1975</p>

		<h3>The Credibility of a Comedian</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The embarrassment is that I&#8217;m given credibility in this world because of the disappointment that the public has in what the news media does. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the television show

		<h3>The Cult of Ignorance</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &#8216;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&#8217; </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the story
			&ldquo;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&rdquo;
		</p>
		<p>&mdash; 1975</p>

		<h3>Every Third American</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>We are, in fact, a nation of evangelists; every third American devotes himself to improving and lifting up his fellow citizens, usually by force; the messianic delusion is our national disease. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>From  the book
			<cite>Prejudices: First Series</cite>
		</p>
		<p>&mdash; 1919</p>

		<h3>The Extent of Freedom in All of its Dimensions</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. </p>

		<h3>Ism-mania</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Grandpa: Penny why don&#8217;t you write a play about ism-mania? </p>

<p>Penny: Ism-mania? </p>

<p>Grandpa: Yeah, sure, you know &#8211; communism, fascism, voodooism. Everybody&#8217;s got an ism these days. </p>

<p>Penny: I feel like I&#8217;ve got this itch or something. </p>

<p>Grandpa: It&#8217;s just as catching. When things go a little bad nowadays, you go out and get yourself an ism and you&#8217;re in business. </p>

<p>Penny: I&#8217;ve got it! It might help Cynthia to have an ism in the monastery! </p>

<p>Grandpa: It might at that. Only give her Americanism. Let her know something about Americans: John Paul Jones, Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, Lincoln, Grant, Lee, Edison, Mark Twain. When things got tough for those boys, they didn&#8217;t run around looking for isms. Lincoln said, &#8220;With malice toward none, with charity for all.&#8221; Nowadays they say, &#8220;Think the way I do, or I&#8217;ll bomb the daylights out of you.&#8221; </p>

		<h3>The Makers of Things</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted &#8211; for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things &#8211; some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. </p>
		</blockquote>
