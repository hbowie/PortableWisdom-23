<h2>Notable Quotations on the topic of progress</h2>

		<hr />

		<h3>An agenda of ambition and hope</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>This spirit of fraternity must enable us to build an agenda of ambition and hope, as our two countries share the same faith in freedom, in democratic values, in empowerment through education and work, and in progress through science and knowledge. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>The cause which is blocking all progress</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The cause which is blocking all progress today is the subtle scepticism which whispers in a million ears that things are not good enough to be worth improving. If the world is good we are revolutionaries, if the world is evil we must be conservatives. These essays, futile as they are considered as serious literature, are yet ethically sincere, since they seek to remind men that things must be loved first and improved afterwards. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>The Change Dilemma</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Our dilemma is that we hate change and love it at the same time; what we really want is for things to remain the same but get better. </p>

		<h3>Changing the World</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Never doubt that a small, group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has. </p>

		<h3>Conservatives and Progressives</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected. Even when the revolutionist might himself repent of his revolution, the traditionalist is already defending it as part of his tradition. Thus we have two great types &#8211; the advanced person who rushes us into ruin, and the retrospective person who admires the ruins. He admires them especially by moonlight, not to say moonshine. Each new blunder of the progressive or prig becomes instantly a legend of immemorial antiquity for the snob. This is called the balance, or mutual check, in our Constitution. </p>

		<h3>Critical Thinking Followed by Action</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Interviewer: What&#8217;s the most important meditation we can do now? </p>

<p>Dalai Lama: Critical thinking, followed by action. Discern what your world is. Know the plot, the scenario of this human drama. And then figure out where your talents might fit in to make a better world. </p>

		<h3>Introduction of a new order of things</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. </p>
		</blockquote>

		<h3>Life can be much broader</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. </p>

		<h3>The Makers of Things</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted &#8211; for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things &#8211; some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and freedom. </p>

		<h3>Most humans desire cultural stability, not change</h3>

		<h3>People ask me to predict the future</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>People ask me to predict the future, when all I want to do is prevent it. Better yet, build it. Predicting the future is much too easy, anyway. You look at the people around you, the street you stand on, the visible air you breathe, and predict more of the same. To hell with more. I want better. </p>

		<h3>Progress Depends on Retentiveness</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Progress, far from consisting in change, depends on retentiveness. When change is absolute there remains no being to improve and no direction is set for possible improvement: and when experience is not retained, as among savages, infancy is perpetual. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. </p>

		<h3>A Return to These Truths</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Our challenges may be new. The instruments with which we meet them may be new. But those values upon which our success depends &#8211; hard work and honesty, courage and fair play, tolerance and curiosity, loyalty and patriotism &#8211; these things are old. These things are true. They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history. What is demanded then is a return to these truths. </p>

		<h3>Small and Obscure Deeds</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>Of all the will toward the ideal in mankind only a small part can manifest itself in public action. All the rest of this force must be content with small and obscure deeds. The sum of these, however, is a thousand times stronger than the acts of those who receive wide public recognition. The latter, compared to the former, are like the foam on the waves of a deep ocean. </p>

		<h3>Steve Jobs Ideals</h3>

<p>A. The importance of doing everything you do to your very best. And that the journey is the reward. If you do things well one at a time, you end up in a really good place. Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself. Control the things you can. </p>

		<h3>Taking a Fence Down</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, I don&#8217;t see the use of this; let us clear it away. To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: If you don&#8217;t see the use of it, I certainly won&#8217;t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it. </p>

		<h3>You are going to have to make it different</h3>

		<blockquote>
			<p>I once addressed, on a Christmas day many years ago, on behalf of the United Nations, an audience of about two thousand school children in London. As on this occasion, I knew in general what I was going to say, but I did not know exactly what I was going to say, and in a moment of abandon I said to them: &#8216;This is how the world goes, you are going to have to make it different, you are going to have to stop listening to your parents. If you go on obeying your parents, the world will never be a better place.&#8217; And at that moment twenty newspaper men representing the European press got up from the front row and rushed for the telephone boxes. And by the time I got home one of the more adventurous correspondents from Geneva had actually phoned my daughter, then aged seven, at school in order to ask her whether she was encouraged to disobey her parents at home. </p>
